# 📊 Pupil Statistics Analysis System

This project was developed for a Structured Programming course using C++. It processes pupil enrollment data from a text file to perform categorization, descriptive statistics and planning-based trend analysis for Primary and Secondary schools, following clear control flow and modular design principles.

# 📌 Features

* Reads pupil enrollment data from a text file
* Categorizes data into Primary and Secondary levels
* Generates separate output files (Primary.txt and Secondary.txt)
* Calculates total pupils, percentages, averages and standard deviation
* Identifies districts with significant enrollment changes (≥20%)
* Menu-driven console interface

# 🛠 Tech Stack

* Language: C++
* Programming Paradigm: Structured Programming
* Libraries Used: iostream, fstream, vector, map, iomanip, cmath

# 📂 Project Files

* main.cpp – Main source code
* Pupil_Statistics.txt – Input data file
* Primary.txt – Output file for Primary school data
* Secondary.txt – Output file for Secondary school data

# ▶️ How to Run the Program (OnlineGDB – C++)

* Open [Online GDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/#) and choose Language C++.
* Download and Upload the file of [main.cpp](https://github.com/niliepl/Structure_Programming/blob/main/main.cpp) into the editor.
* Download and Upload the file named [Pupil_Statistics.txt](https://github.com/niliepl/Structure_Programming/blob/main/Pupil_Statistics.txt) in OnlineGDB.
* Click Run.

| Option | Function                  | Description                                                                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1      | School Category           | Splits data into Primary and Secondary files (`Primary.txt`, `Secondary.txt`).                         |
| 2      | Descriptive Statistics    | Displays total pupils, percentages, averages, and standard deviation per year and district.            |
| 3      | Planning & Trend Analysis | Identifies districts with significant enrollment changes (≥20%) and provides planning recommendations. |


📌 Output files (Primary.txt and Secondary.txt) will be generated automatically.
